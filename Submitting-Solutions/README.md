# Tasks

Anytime a new task is assigned, it will be in a new repo on the `master` branch

- Fork the repo under your account
- Branch and checkout into a `develop` branch
- Work on the solution, use a couple of branches under the Git Flow conventions
- Ask any queries using issues on the *original task repo* with proper links and enough details
- Once you have your working solution, send a Pull Request from your `develop`, to be merged into the original `develop`
