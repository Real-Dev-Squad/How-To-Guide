# Keep in mind

If you were selected to join my squad, where I will be mentoring you, training you, and providing critical feedback to grow into a better software developer, here are the ground rules that will ensure you are not booted off:

- Absolutely no harassment of any kind. No stalking people outside the platform

- Constant updates are a must. Life does get busy, so there are going to be reasonable timelines. But any prolonged inactivity will get you removed, to make way for new people (I have a limited number of people to ensure quality)

- Do your homework first, ask in your peer group, then ask me. Learn to work with your peers better

- Follow instructions well. Clear ambiguity. Make reasonable assumptions and proceed, but make sure you can backtrack and not have to start from scratch

- Once you submit something  I asked for, give me 48 hours to reply. I will sometimes purposefully miss a few messages, to see if you follow up. Ensure you nudge to remind 

- Form a concise question and reach out. No single "hi", "hey". Don't make it too long either. Just enough

## Footnote

Your life is going to be tougher for the next few months, but you will not regret it in the end. All the best!
