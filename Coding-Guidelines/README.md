# Guidelines

4 THINGS to keep in mind when submitting your final result:

- Working Code:  Code that is not correct is of no use to anyone. Fastest wrong answer doesnâ€™t fetch you points
- Readable: Code will be read over multiple times and has to be clean and easy enough to understand for new people
- Extensible: New cases should not break ANY old cases
- Scalable: Manage your complexities. O(n) especially. Time & space
